# 🌌 ASCILINE Engine

**ASCILINE** is a high-performance, real-time ASCII video rendering engine. **Our core objective is to transform the web into a highly dynamic and interactive typographic canvas.** By moving away from traditional video players, ASCILINE streams visual data from a Python backend directly into the browser at **60 FPS** as raw, manipulable text.

## 🎯 Strategic Vision & Core Capabilities

1. **Pure Typographic Manipulation**: The visual stream is not a standard media file—it's raw HTML/Canvas text. This makes the impossible possible: you can apply real-time CSS filters (neon glows, text shadows) to a playing video, dynamically manipulate colors, or let users literally copy a moving visual element with their cursor.
2. **Local AI & LLM Ready**: By reducing complex pixel streams into structured logical strings, ASCILINE acts as a perfect bridge for AI. Instead of feeding heavy computer vision models, lightweight text blocks can be fed directly to Local LLMs. Analyzing visual changes becomes as simple as taking a "diff" between two text strings.
3. **Ultra-Low Bandwidth & IoT Compatibility**: Standard codecs (H.264/VP9) choke microcontrollers and weak networks. ASCILINE processes the heavy lifting once on the backend, streaming only a few kilobytes of String packets per second via WebSockets. It enables zero-latency live streams on satellite connections, embedded systems, and extreme low-bandwidth environments.
4. **Bypassing Browser Constraints**: Modern browsers aggressively throttle autoplay videos, and ad-blockers restrict traditional media frames. To the browser, ASCILINE is simply "JavaScript updating text on a page." This circumvents traditional restrictions, allowing for immediate, unblockable visual streams.

## 🚀 Technical Features

-   **Real-Time Streaming**: Low-latency video-to-ASCII conversion.
-   **High Performance**: Uses **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering instead of heavy DOM elements, enabling 60 FPS playback.
-   **Binary Protocol**: Frames are encoded into `Uint8Array` (binary) for efficient bandwidth usage.
-   **Multiple Color Modes**: Supports everything from classic B&W to 16M color ultra-fidelity.
-   **Modern Aesthetic**: Premium dark-mode UI with interactive ripple dissolve effects.

## 🛠️ Architecture

1.  **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: Decodes video using OpenCV, maps pixels to ASCII characters via NumPy, and streams binary data.
2.  **Frontend (Vanilla JS)**: Receives binary frames via WebSockets, manages a jitter buffer, and renders to a Canvas grid.
3.  **Communication**: Optimized WebSocket protocol with a custom `INIT` handshake for dynamic resolution/FPS adjustment.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ASCILINE.git
cd ASCILINE
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn opencv-python numpy websockets
```

### 3. Run the Web Server
Place a `video.mp4` in the root directory and start the server:
```bash
python stream_server.py
```
Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### 4. Run directly in Terminal (Standalone)
If you prefer to bypass the web interface, you can render the video directly inside an ANSI-supported terminal (zero-flicker, true color):
```bash
python ascii_video_player2.py video.mp4 --quality 0
```

## 🎨 Customization

You can easily customize the look and feel of the engine:

### Styling
Edit `style.css` to change the accent colors and typography using CSS variables:
```css
:root {
    --accent-color: #00ff41; /* Classic Matrix Green */
    --bg-color: #050505;
}
```

### Rendering Modes
The engine supports different fidelity levels via the `--mode` flag:
- `1`: Black & White (DOM mode)
- `2`: 512 Colors
- `3`: 32K Colors
- `4`: 262K Colors
- `5`: 16M Colors (Ultra)

```bash
python stream_server.py --mode 5 --cols 240 --rows 100
```

## 📜 License & Ethical Guardrails

**MIT License (with Anti-Ad Restriction)**

ASCILINE is distributed under the MIT License, but with a strict ethical guardrail.
Because this engine bypasses standard browser constraints and ad-blockers (by rendering pure text instead of video), we strictly prohibit its use by ad-networks to serve unblockable advertisements.
